== Description ==

Use this simple shortcode to hide any content in your posts/pages. It will then replace the content between the shortcode with a form a user would have to fill out to see said content. Right now the form consists of a name field, email address, comment field, and spam deterant.

There are also two options for the shortcode. 1) capability => defaults to 'level_10'. 2) text => defualts to empty (and new text you'd like placed before the form).

1. Use: `[replace text="Please fill out the form below to see the content"]`this is the content being replaced`[/replace]`
